# SmartGallery CBIR System
### *AI-Powered Content-Based Image Retrieval with YOLOv8*

SmartGallery is a high-performance **Full-Stack CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval)** system. It allows users to upload images, automatically detect objects using a fine-tuned **YOLOv8** model, extract deep visual features (Color, Texture, Shape), and perform similarity searches across a gallery.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite), TailwindCSS, Axios.
- **Backend:** Flask, Flask-RESTful, Gunicorn.
- **AI/ML:** Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Image.
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx (Reverse Proxy).

## The AI Pipeline Workflow

The system follows a sophisticated 5-step pipeline to ensure high-accuracy image retrieval:

### 1. Image Ingestion & Management
User uploads an image via the React interface. The **ImageManager** service handles storage and serves the files through an Nginx-proxied static route.

### 2. Object Detection (YOLOv8)
The backend runs the query image through a fine-tuned **YOLOv8n** model trained on 15 specific categories. It identifies bounding boxes (BBox) and class labels.
> **Categories:** *Person, Bicycle, Car, Airplane, Boat, Traffic Light, Bird, Cat, Dog, Horse, Umbrella, Bottle, Apple, Pizza, Laptop.*

### 3. Background Removal (Segmentation)
To ensure color features are extracted only from the object (and not the background), the system uses **YOLOv8-Segmentation**.
> *Workflow:* BBox -> Mask Generation -> Bitwise-AND Masking -> Isolated Object ROI.

### 4. Multimodal Feature Extraction
For every isolated object, we extract:
- **Color:** RGB/HSV Histograms & K-Means Dominant Colors (5 clusters).
- **Texture:** Tamura Descriptors (Contrast, Coarseness) & Gabor Filters.
- **Shape:** Hu Moments & Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).

### 5. Similarity Search
Query features are compared against the `features.json` database using a **Weighted Euclidean Distance** algorithm. Results are filtered by class to ensure semantic relevance.

## DevOps Architecture

The project is built with a production-first Docker architecture:

</p>

### Key Optimizations:
- **Offline Inference:** `YOLO_OFFLINE=True` environment variable prevents the system from crashing due to GitHub rate limits or lack of internet.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx handles CORS and allows large file uploads (50MB) for high-resolution image processing.
- **Resource Management:** Configured with 1 Gunicorn worker and 300s timeout to handle heavy AI CPU tasks without race conditions.
